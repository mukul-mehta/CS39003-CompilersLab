Assignments completed during the compilers lab course during my 5th semester (Autumn 2020, right THAT HECK OF A SEMESTER)



The objective of the lab was to build a toy compiler for TinyC. Multiple assignments are the intermediate steps: Lexes, Parser, Machine Independent Code Translation and Target Code generation. There are README's present in each of the assignment folders
